Maaz is a nerd - turned - community builder - turned - (entrepreneur?) who has evolved from wanting to build software to now building a business around it! \n\nMaaz enjoys the practice of being a peoples' person being at the forefront of the business strategy, personal branding and morning tone setting before the day at VECTOR starts. Maaz loves to practice, two inspirational but un-related concepts; Stoicism and Alchemy where these him navigate through acceptance, meaning and passion. \n",
